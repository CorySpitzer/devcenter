[.lead]
JBoss Fuse for xPaaS is an enterprise service bus technology for building and implementing communication between different applications, services, and data. It is specifically designed for extensive connectivity. It includes JBoss A-MQ for xPaaS, a messaging service to connect applications and devices using notifications and messages.

== Overview
With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run JBoss Fuse for xPaaS components like messaging brokers and containers and deploy solutions to connect applications and data using the most extensive set of messaging protocols and connectors. JBoss Fuse for xPaaS is available on OpenShift Enterprise and provides private iPaaS like capabilities.

JBoss Fuse is also available on OpenShift Online as a Developer Preview.

We are making this technology available under the link:http://www.jboss.org/developer-program/termsandconditions[terms and conditions] of our JBoss Developer Program. By loading the cartridge you accept these terms which generally state that you can use this cartridge for development purposes and not for production or to access updates without an active Red Hat subscription.

== Multi-protocol
As developers it is all too common that we want to connect to things that don't necessarily use the same protocols. When we build all the applications we can choose how they communicate but more often than not we need to connect to someone else's application or data source. And that means the technology we use to connect should be like JBoss Fuse - able to connect via the widest variety of protocols. So whether its HTTP, JMS, REST or newer protocols like AMQP and MQTT JBoss Fuse provides connectors to those and more.

== Dynamic
Things change. Your configurations should be able to change along with them and with JBoss Fuse you can alter configurations while your connections are running. Deploy or update services easily while JBoss Fuse is running.

== Visual Design
Using the web console included with JBoss Fuse, you can build your connections with easy to use drag and drop tooling to visually build your connections and monitor them running in this same visual form.

== Integration by the Book
Connect your applications, services and data using standard pattern based integrations from the foremost book on the subject - Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing Building and Deploying Messaging Solutions by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. JBoss Fuse embraces these patterns and the standards they provide for notation, vocabulary and visual depiction. You can drag and drop the patterns from a palette in the JBoss Fuse tooling for faster solutions.

== Rapid Development with an IDE
Don't like the command line or web console for designing connections between applications and data? No problem! Use link:https://blog.openshift.com/getting-started-with-eclipse-paas-integration[JBoss Tools with Eclipse] to create and work with your connections.

== Connectors
Since Fuse includes Apache Camel you get the benefit of the full assortment of Camel Connectors like Salesforce, SAP, Twitter, etc. Many of these connectors are included in the cartridge as samples that you can look at, learn from and adapt to your needs.

=== OpenShift Enterprise
JBoss Fuse for xPaaS is available on OpenShift Enterprise.
Please check the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Fuse/6.1/html/Cloud_Deployment_Guide/files/front.html[Cloud deployment guide] to deploy JBoss Fuse for xPaaS on OpenShift Enterprise.

* link:https://vimeo.com/111374122[Twitter example]
* link:https://vimeo.com/111374272[Overview]

=== OpenShift Online
JBoss Fuse is also available on OpenShift Online as a Developer Preview to allow you to explore the capabilities of Apache ActiveMQ messaging and Apache Camel integration framework running on OpenShift. This preview is based on the JBoss Fuse 6.1 supported release but as a preview it does not come with guaranteed support. It can and likely will change as we make updates based on your use and feedback. Think of it in traditional product terms as an Alpha release. There will be fixes and updates frequently over the short term followed by a Beta release and then a supported release.

==== Getting Started with Fuse ESB
Getting the JBoss Fuse messaging and integration capabilities deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as clicking link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_type/quickstart!40[Deploy Now] or executing the following command:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app fuse https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/fuse-openshift-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
--

These commands create your Fuse instance and install and configure the admin console. You can now begin in the fuse console at:

[source]
--
https://myApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

JBoss xPaaS services on OpenShift are powerful middleware cartridges that we are making available as Alpha releases for developers to experiment with and explore. While you can deploy these cartridges in our free OpenShift Online small gears, we would recommend medium or large gears for optimum performance. You can upgrade to the OpenShift Bronze or Silver tier to leverage medium or large gears and visit the link:https://help.openshif.com[OpenShift Help Center] if you need further assistance.

See our link:#faq[FAQ] page answers to common questions.

==== Installation Option 1: Using the QuickStart / OpenShift web console
Start by logging into your OpenShift account (don't have one? Click link:https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new[here] to sign up) and going to either the QuickStart page and clicking the "Deploy Now" button or the OpenShift console by clicking "My Apps" in the upper right corner of your browser.

image::xpaas/xpaas-fuse-1.jpg[Logging in to OpenShift]

If you use the OpenShift console click the "Add Application" button below your list of applications or the "Create your first application now" link. You can either search for "Fuse" or you can scroll down to the list of quick links and click "JBoss Fuse 6.1" under "Integration". This will bring you to the "Configure Application" step (see below.)

image::xpaas/xpaas-fuse-2.jpg[Jboss Fuse Cartridge]

If you use the QuickStart, click on the "Deploy Now" button. This will bring you directly to the "Configure Application" step.

To configure the application you will need to configure your application's public URL. Choose a name for this application (e.g. "Fuse", "Fusetest" or whatever you like.) You don't need to enter anything in the Source Code field. If you have access to multiple gear sizes select the size you want to use. We recommend a medium gear if you have access to one. The Fuse cartridge will run perfectly well in a small gear but you may find it to be a bit slow.

Make your Scaling selection - "No scaling" will work just fine - and then hit "Create Application" and OpenShift will build the application for you. When that is complete you will see the "Next Steps" page and you can decide whether you want to change the code of the application. For now select "Not now". The next page will have some important information for you so don't go speeding past it.

In the first line you will see the URL for your Fuse cartridge. A bit further down you'll see the auto generated login credentials. Save these because you will need them to login to the Fuse Management Console. Once you have this information recorded click on the "Continue to the application overview page" link.

image::xpaas/xpaas-fuse-3.jpg[Jboss Fuse Application Overview]

Clicking that link will bring you to the Applications view in OpenShift where you will see your new Fuse application listed. Click on the application and you will see the URL for the running application and details about the cartridge. Click on the URL and that will take you to the login screen for the Fuse Management Console. Enter the user name and password you recorded and click log in. You will then see the Fuse Management Console welcome page.

And that's it. You are now running Fuse on OpenShift. Woo hoo!

==== Installation Option 2: Using the command line tools (rhc)
If you want to use the link:managing-client-tools.html[rhc command line] type:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app fuse https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/fuse-openshift-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
--

This will output the generated password for fabric and also the http url for hawtio. If you prefer to specify your own password (which can be handy in development to reuse the same password across fabrics) try this:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app -e OPENSHIFT_FUSE_ZOOKEEPER_PASSWORD=admin fuse https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/fuse-openshift-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
--

You probably want to use a safer password than 'admin' though ;) If you have a subscription for OpenShift that gives you access to other gear sizes, you could run

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app -g medium -e OPENSHIFT_FUSE_ZOOKEEPER_PASSWORD=admin fuse https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/fuse-openshift-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
--

That will create the container in an OpenShift gear of the specified size. You can then login to your registry at:

[source]
--
https://fuse-$USERID.rhcloud.com/hawtio/
--

Where $USERID is your OpenShift account name. Use the following login:

[source]
--
user: admin
password: $password
--

[[faq]]
== Fuse FAQ
[qanda]
How do I load the cartridge on OpenShift?::
  Just like any downloadable cartridge on OpenShift there are two ways to install the Fuse 6.1 Alpha cartridge. You can either use the OpenShift console or the command line. For instructions check out our link:#getting-started[Getting Started] section.
Where do I go for support?::
  The best places to go for support are the OpenShift link:/help[Help Center] or the link:http://fusesource.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=1[Fuse community boards]. We would love to have your input so go where you're most comfortable and we will see it.
What does it mean that this is an "Alpha" cartridge?::
  JBoss Fuse on OpenShift is based on a pre-release version of JBoss Fuse 6.1 and like any pre-release software its constantly undergoing testing and improvements on its way to general availability. There are also unique requirements to running Fuse on a cloud platform like OpenShift and some of those are in development. So we felt the term "Alpha" was an industry wide term that conveyed the right sense of where this technology is - its targeted at production use cases but not production supported at this time.
What is the cartridge lifecyle?::
  JBoss Middleware cartridges will advance through several stages on OpenShift. Many will begin life as cartridges based on their community projects (like WildFly). Others will start out based on pre-release versions of our supported projects as part of the JBoss Developer program which provides developer access to pre-release products under the JBoss Developer Program Terms and Conditions.
+
Community cartridges will reflect their community projects and will change with as their communities update them. If you wish to use the updates, you will have to re-install the cartridge.
+
Alpha cartridges are pre-release versions of supported products. They are released under the JBoss Developer Program link:http://www.jboss.org/developer-program/termsandconditions[terms and conditions] and are intended only for development use and not for production use or to access updates to products without a Red Hat subscription. Alpha cartridges will be updated as the product progresses to beta. As with any alpha software, there will be sharp edges and unfinished pieces but those are a worthwhile tradeoff for early access to the direction of future products.
+
Beta cartridges are also pre-release and covered by the JBoss Developer Program terms and conditions. As beta code, these cartridges will naturally be closer to finished products and will be updated as the product proceeds to general release.
+
Once the product is finished we will release a version of the cartridge based on the final release.
Does this mean Fuse will be supported?::
  JBoss Fuse for xPaaS is generally available on OpenShift Enterprise.
+
The release of community, alpha or beta cartridges should not be viewed as a commitment to release a supported cartridge. However the release of alpha/beta cartridges can rightly be viewed as an expression of intent absent specific timing.
Where do I go to learn more about Fuse?::
  For more information about JBoss Fuse you can visit http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse or http://www.redhat.com/
What will the performance be like in a small gear?::
  If you choose to run Fuse in a small gear you will experience slower performance as tasks take a little bit longer to complete. For instance, when you create a new container, that process may take one or two minutes rather than create in a matter of seconds if you're using a small gear.
